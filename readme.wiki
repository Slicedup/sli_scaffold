##Overview

The Slicedup Scaffold plugin provides application scaffolding, which allows
you to create a basic application structure to perform C.R.U.D. actions on 
data collections, while writing little or NO application code.

##Installation

1. Install as `slicedup_scaffold` to your application's `libraries` directory.

2. Add to your application in your bootstrap.
{{{
//app/config/bootstrap/libraries.php
Libraries::add('slicedup_scaffold');
}}}

##Configuration & Usage

Unconfigured, Slicedup Scaffold will accept CRUD requests for any data
collection configured in your default datasource.

**You do not need to write any more code to create your scaffolded application!**

####Full Scaffold
Create a database table, or collection in your datasource of choice, this 
collection should follow the convention of using a pluralized name, e.g. 
`posts`, `pages` or `users`.

Now access the scaffold for your collection by visiting the url that matches
your collection name, e.g. `/posts`, `/pages` or `/users`.

####Model Only Scaffold
Building on what we have achieved above, once you have created your data
collection you can now create your model class, e.g. `app\models\Post`. Your
`posts` scaffolds will now use your `Post` model for all data handling, allowing
you access to manipulate your data pre & post CRUD actions at model level.

####Partial Controller Scaffold
Scaffolded actions are directed through the plugin's `ScaffoldController`. To
begin building your application request/response actions, you can start creating
your own application controllers while still utilizing the scaffold for the
default actions. To enable scaffolding on a controller you have created, we simply
add the class property `scaffold`.
{{{
namespace app\controlers;
class PostsController extends \lithium\action\Controller {
	public $scaffold;
}
}}}
By default the plugin will scaffold actions named `index`, `view`, `add`, `edit`
and `delete`. If you want to add another action to your scaffolded controller,
simply define it in your controller e.g.
{{{
namespace app\controlers;
class PostsController extends \lithium\action\Controller {
	public $scaffold;
	public function archives(){
		//do some things here!
	}
}
}}}
Requests to `/posts` are now dispatched to your `PostsController`, actions that
have been defined, in this case `archives`, will be invoked in the standard
request cycle. However the scaffold actions not defined by this controller
will be re-routed through an instance of the `ScaffoldController`.

####Full Controller Scaffold
If your application intends to use scaffolding permanently, you may opt to
directly extend the `ScaffoldController` itself. This can be done so freely
and should not create any issues moving forward.

####Mixed Scaffold
There is no limitation on what you scaffold and what you don't, scaffolded
controllers & models can be used completely independantly.

####Scaffold Templates
Scaffold view templates are loaded by default from the plugin's templates, but
you are free to create views for your scaffolds, these will be used if they exist.
Create them as you would normally in your controller views directory.

####Configuration Options
Scaffolding is controlled by configuring the `slicedup_scaffold\util\Scaffold`
class, and additionally by setting options within your own controllers `scaffold`
property.

#####Current global configuration options:

`all` : this controls the plugin's ability to catch requests for controllers that
do no exist, and for which you have not created a scaffold config. By default
this option is `true` enabling full scaffolding from your existing controllers
and/or datasource collections.

#####Current scaffold configurations options

`controller` : configure a non standard controller class for accepting incoming
scaffold requests
`model` : configure a non standard model class for data hanndling

#####Configuration Examples

{{{
use slicedup_scaffold\util\Scaffold;

//Global
Scaffold::config(array(
	'all' => false, //disable catch all scaffolds
	'scaffold' => array('posts', 'pages') //accept scaffolds for posts & pages
));

//Individual scaffold config
Scaffold::set('users', $options); //enable scaffolds for users
}}}

##Development
Development is ongoing, no roadmap or equivilant formality exists at the present time.

###Planned Features, Limitations & Known Isssues
* Complete scaffold feld set mappings to control fields used in each scaffolds from models
* Allow models to further affect scaffolds
* Use appropriate form fields for relevant data
* Ability to apply custom form field mappings, globally as sets, and per model
* Incorporate search into index action
* Pagination for index action
* Scaffold display action for template display
* Scaffold _groups_
* Greater control & flexibility of templates
* Support scaffolds in any library
* Scaffold associations
* More Docs & Tests of course!
